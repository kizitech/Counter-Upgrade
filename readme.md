## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have a modern web browser installed (such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge) to run the application.

2. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kizitech/Counter-Upgrade.git
```

3. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd Counter
```

## Usage

1. Open the project directory and locate the `index.html` file. Open it with your web browser.

2. You will see a webpage with a counter displayed in the center and three buttons labeled "DECREASE", "RESET and "INCREASE".

3. To increment the counter, click the "INCREASE" button. Each click will increase the counter value by 1.

4. To decrement the counter, click the "DECREASE" button. Each click will decrease the counter value by 1.

5. To reset the counter, click the "RESET" button. Each click will reset the counter value to 0.

## Customization

If you want to customize the application or integrate it into your project, here's a quick overview of the project structure:

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the webpage, including the counter and buttons.

- `style.css`: Contains the CSS rules and styles for the webpage, including the positioning and appearance of the counter and buttons.

- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code responsible for incrementing and decrementing the counter and updating the count on the webpage.

Feel free to modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to suit your needs.
